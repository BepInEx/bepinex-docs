# Debugging plugins

Debugging BepInEx plugins can pose a challenge depending on the game and the plugin.  
Currently there are two ways to debug plugins and Unity games

1. Using dnSpy and its debug builds of the Mono runtime
2. Converting the game to debug build and using Visual Studio Tools for Unity (or Rider's Unity extension) 

Depending on your needs an tooling, you might need to use different approaches 
to debugging Unity games. If you are unsure which way to use, we suggest 
first trying out debugging with dnSpy.

Please refer to specific debugging guides on the subpages.
